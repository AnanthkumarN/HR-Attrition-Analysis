## Project Overview

Employee attrition is a critical issue for organizations as it impacts productivity and costs. This project aims to:

- Analyze factors influencing employee attrition.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and insights.
- Build machine learning models to predict employee attrition.
- Suggest actionable insights to reduce turnover.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values and inconsistent data.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Removing outliers using statistical techniques (e.g., IQR).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing attrition trends by age, department, and other factors.
  - Generating histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, if implemented)
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC Curve and AUC Score
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifying key predictors of attrition.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns (example):

- **EmployeeID**: Unique identifier for each employee.
- **Age**: Employee's age.
- **Department**: Department in which the employee works.
- **JobSatisfaction**: Satisfaction level of the employee with their job.
- **Attrition**: Target variable indicating whether the employee left the organization.

Additional columns represent demographic, performance, and satisfaction metrics.

## Usage

- Execute the notebook cell by cell to reproduce the analysis and results.
- Update the dataset path if required.
- Experiment with additional machine learning models or hyperparameter tuning.
